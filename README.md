# Sparse Bayesian Generative Modeling for Compressive Sensing

Welcome to the (preliminary) repository for the paper "Sparse Bayesian Generative Modeling for Compressive Sensing"! The code is currently in the process of preperation and may change continuously.

## Abstract

In our work, we combine the sparsity-promoting properties from classical dictionary-based compressive sensing with generative modeling to improve machine learning-aided compressive sensing and reduce the requirements on the quality and size of the training data.
