# Sparse Bayesian Generative Modeling for Compressive Sensing

Welcome to the (preliminary) repository for the paper "Sparse Bayesian Generative Modeling for Compressive Sensing"! The code is currently in the process of preperation and may change continuously. 

The code will be uploaded during the week of December 16-22.

## Abstract

In our work, we combine the sparsity-promoting properties from classical dictionary-based compressive sensing with generative modeling to improve machine learning-aided compressive sensing and reduce the requirements on the quality and size of the training data.
